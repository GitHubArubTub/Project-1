### **Overview**

#### This repository contains all the necessary code and files for Project 1 - Portfolio Analyzer. The aim of this project was to create a program to analyze a portfolio's performance using a benchmark (in this case, the S&P 500 (SPY index)).
###### ----------------------------
#### The analyzer seeks to compare the previous 5 years of portfolio performance to the SPY index and then to also simulate the next 5 years to give an idea of future performance. The idea is to provide the user with plenty of visualizations and feedback so that decisions and analyses can then be made based on what the results show.
###### ----------------------------
#### This jupyter notebook uses various python libraries including pandas, mathplotlib, numpy, and a new library not used in class called Quantstats. The program also generates a .html file which has a full comparison and visual analysis automatically generated by Quantstats. The file is titled *Portfolio_vs_S&P500_Tearsheet.html* in this repo. Quantstats will need to be installed in order for that portion of the program to execute correctly. This can be done using a simple 'pip install quantstats' command in the user's terminal.
###### ----------------------------
#### Examples of all outputs can be found in the *Images* folder within this repo and can also be seen below. Also of note is that the main file for the project, *project-1.ipynb*, is optimized for use with an extension called Voila, which can be easily installed in Jupyter Lab. This provides a cleaner way to visualize the program output within Jupyter Lab without the need for messy code mixed in. Additionally, the file *MCForecastTools1.py* is a necessary file needed for running Monte Carlo simulations. This file was provided in class but has been edited from its original format to better fit within this project.

#
#### The project is broken down into a four main areas of analysis: 
#### - Portfolio Data Analysis
#### - Historic Drawdown Analysis
#### - Risk Analysis
#### - Simulation Analysis
#

## **Portfolio Data Analysis:**
#### This portion of the project provides some insight into the makeup of the portfolio as well as a heatmap of past performance. These are the outputs from this section, including a pie chart showing portfolio composition and a heatmap showing historic portfolio monthly returns:

#

## **Historic Drawdown Analysis:**
#### This portion of the project uses the Alpaca API to gather 5 years of stock performance  so as to compare and contrast the performance of the weighted portfolio with a benchmark, the SPY index. These are the outputs from this section which compares both the historic drawdowns over the period as well as the cumulative returns:

#

## **Risk Analysis:**
#### This section uses dataframe manipulation and risk calculations to give an idea of how risky the portfolio is versus the relatively risk-adverse SPY index. This type of analysis gives an idea of whether or not eh possible future returns are work the risk to the initial investment. These are the outputs from this section which show a box plot showing daily return variance, sharp ratios, and a line chart of the 30-day rolling beta vs the SPY index:

#

## **Simulation Analysis:**
#### The final section of the program uses a Monte Carlo simulation to give an idea of potential future performance. The simulation analysis is carried out on both the weighted portfolio and the SPY index so as to compare the results. These are the outputs from this section which are a line chart showing the simulation trajectories, a distribution bar chart showing the results of the simulations and a final output showing the simulation summary statistics where comparisons and decisions can be made (please note that the following visualizations are only examples and that they will be different every time the program is run):

## **Results and Recommendations**
#### The results of the analysis above shows a fairly strong correlation between the custom portfolio and the SPY index (very similar historic drawdowns and returns). The portfolio has slightly higher risk (slightly higher sharpe ratio and variance) and the simulation results show only a slight increase in potential returns as compared to the benchmark. If the user would like to take on additional risk, they can swap a low-risk, low-yield stock within the portfolio with a higher one, such as an additional tech company, or they can redistribute the weights of their portfolio stocks to more heavily feature a company such as Microsoft instead of a company like FedEx. Ultimately, any changes to the user portfolio will be based on the risk tolerance of the user!
